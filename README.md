# Python Rock Paper Scissors

I originally created this program as a lab for my Introduction to Programming course in college. 

Recently, I have wanted to learn more about Python so I decided to revamp the project in order to better improve my Python skillz.

This is a rock paper scissors simulator made in Python 3.6, it prompts the user to pick an option, Rock, Paper, or Scissors.

After the user has picked an option, the program will then also choose an option at random.

Once both options have been picked, the program will compare them and inform the user of the results of their match!

### Installation

2. Verify you have python 3 installed
